## Google Colaboratory

We will be using Google Colaboratory ("Colab") to run code in this workshop. Colab in a free Jupyter notebook environment
that runs in the cloud and stores its notebooks on Google Drive. To use Colab you will need to sign in to a Google account. 
(Note: Caltech Google accounts do not provide access to Colab. You will need to use a personal account.)

An introduction to Google Colab is available here: [https://research.google.com/colaboratory/](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)

Before the workshop please confirm that you have a Google Account with access to Colab.
