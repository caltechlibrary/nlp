## Introduction

This workshop provides a brief introduction to Natural Language Programming using Python.
It covers text manipulation and processing using core Python functions, as well as the 
NLTK and spaCy programming libraries.

The workshop is limited to the processing of text, and does not include speech recognition
or speech processing. Topics covered include the manipulation of text, word contexts and
frequency distribution, parts of speech, named entities, and sentiment analysis.

During COVID the workshop is taught online in three one-hour sessions. Ideally, the workshop
would be taught in person, in three two-hour sessions, with time for exercises and discussion.
