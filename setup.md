## 2. Environment

The workshop assumes use of a Jupyter Notebook to run code examples. JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab are all 
good options. JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook can be downloaded as part of the [Anaconda data science suite](https://anaconda.com).
Google Colab in a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook implementation.

### Google Colaboratory

We will be using Google Colaboratory ("Colab") to run code in this workshop. Colab is a free Jupyter Notebook environment
that runs in the cloud and stores its notebooks on Google Drive. To use Colab you will need to sign in to a Google account. 
(Note: Caltech Google accounts do not provide access to Colab. You will need to use a personal account.)

An introduction to Google Colab is available here: [https://research.google.com/colaboratory/](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)

Before the workshop please confirm that you have a Google Account with access to Colab.
