## Strings and their properties

Here is an example of a string:

    'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.'

Strings are designated by bounding single or double quotes.

This is a different string:

    '  Peter Piper picked a  peck of pickled peppers. '

The length property of a string is evaluated with the len() function:

    len('  Peter Piper picked a  peck of pickled peppers. ')

Note that the length includes the spaces.
