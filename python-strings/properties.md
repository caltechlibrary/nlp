## Strings and their properties

Here is an example of a string:

    'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.'

Strings are designated by bounding single or double quotes.

This is a different string:

    '  Peter Piper picked a  peck of pickled peppers. '

The length property of a string is evaluated with the len() function:

    len('  Peter Piper picked a  peck of pickled peppers. ')

Note that the length includes the spaces.

**Exercise:** Use the len() function to measure the length of the two strings above.

A 'function' is code that is independent of a specific object. A 'method' is code that is associated with an object. 
Use a period and the method name to access it, like this:

    'Peter Piper picked'.upper()

**Exercise:** 

What does the `upper()` method do? Explore the following string methods:
