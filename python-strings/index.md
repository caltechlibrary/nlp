## 3. Text processing in Python

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Examples of objects are strings, integers, real numbers,
dataframes, and arrays. Objects have data (e.g. letters, numbers), attributes (e.g. length, dimensions), and methods 
(i.e. associated code).

In this part of he workshop we will explore Python string objects. A string object is simply an ordered string of symbols
(mostly letters), with properties or attributes (e.g. length), and methods (code).
