## 3.2 Strings as Iterables

A string is an ordered set of symbols: letters, numbers, and other characters.
The position of each symbol can be ascertained with with .index() method. The following will
return the position of 't' in the string. Note that the first position is '0', not '1'.
This is known as 'zero-based' indexing.

    s = 'Once upon a time...'
    print(s.index('t'))
